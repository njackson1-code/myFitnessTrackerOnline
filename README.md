# myFitnessTrackerOnline

This is a website I created after my internship was cancelled due to covid. 

It is a fitness webstie that allows a user to set their fitnessgoals, to track their data, and to follow their progress.

It makes use of HTML/CSS/Javascript as the core for the frontend. It also uses Jquery, some php, and a couple of frameworks.

For the backend, it is made up of mostly php which connects to a SQL database for storing the user data.
